Atmel Performance Analyzer

IRQ handler is defined in

~/making/perf_analyzer/ASF/thirdparty/wireless/avr2025_mac/source/tal/at86rf215/src/tal_irq_handler.

Some processing of the IRQ status is performed in the handler but some if
deferred to the TAL task by updating a volatile variable that holds the latest
register value.

SPI read/write routines are defined in

~/making/perf_analyzer/ASF/thirdparty/wireless/services/trx_access/trx_access_2.c

The TAL task function is defined in

~/making/perf_analyzer/ASF/thirdparty/wireless/avr2025_mac/source/tal/at86rf215/src/tal.c




For now we don't care for the 2.4 GHz radio and associated baseband core. The
only exception is when we clear the IRQ line at initialization for which we need
to read the 2.4 GHz radio IRQ status register.



On the RPi, interrupt GPIO is BCM 23





uncrustify -c ~/making/zephyr/.uncrustify.cfg --replace ping.c


AT86RF215 Channel Configuration

OFDM Option1 in in the 902–928 frequency band

ChanSpacing: 1.2 MHz
TotalNumChan: 20
ChanCenterFreq0: 903.2 Mhz

Center frequency for channel 3 is 906.8 according to

ChanCenterFreq = ChanCenterFreq0 + NumChan × ChanSpacing




Do NOT enable SPI in Raspberry Pi boot config file 

sudo dtoverlay at86rf233
